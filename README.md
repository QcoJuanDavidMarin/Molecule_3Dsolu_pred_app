# Molecule_3Dsolu_pred_app
In this streamlit app programmed with python it is possible to get a molecular structure in 2D and 3D from a “SMILE”, also calculate its Log solubility value, besides show some its names. The aim of this app is getting a fast way to predict a physicochemical property also other descriptions from a string “SMILE” nomenclature
